GPURealTimeBC6H
=======

Real-time BC6H compressor which runs on a GPU. Includes a small testbed application. This compressor is used in a few released AA/AAA games.

Compressor has two presets: 
* "Fast" - compresses a standard 256x256x6 cubemap in 0.02ms on NV P4000 (GPU perf in between NV GTX 1060 and NV GTX 1070). Compression quality is comparable to fast presets of offline compressors.
* "Quality" - compresses a standard 256x256x6 cubemap in 0.528ms on on NV P4000. Compression quality is comparable to normal presets of offline compressors.

Algorithms
===
Algorithms are based on:
* "Real-Time DXT Compression" by J.M.P. van Waveren, 2006
* "High Quality DXT Compression using CUDA" by Ignacio Casta√±o, 2007

With some modifications for handling HDR range, new encoding modes and format, and optimizing for a perceptual error (optimizing for a log luminance error instead of a plain RGB error).

Quality
===
Quality compared using RMSLE (lower is better).
